##The objective of this assignment is to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

This repo contains:

1) The file run_analysis.R with the script for performing the analysis;

2) The code book describing the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
